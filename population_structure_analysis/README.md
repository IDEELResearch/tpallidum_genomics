## *Treponema pallidum* population structure analysis

#### 1- Read alignment

For *T. pallidum* population structure analysis we mapped the sequences to a modified Nichols reference genome (CP004010.2) masked for *arp*, *TP0470* and *tpr* genes.

#### 2- PCA analysis

#### 3- FastBAPS analysis
For the fastbaps we first constructed a maximum likelihood phylogeny using IQ-tree. Then BAPS were determined with fastbaps.
